            <p>Welcome to UniGo, the ultimate ride-sharing solution tailored for the University of Regina community! We
                provide a sustainable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional public transportation. Our web
                based platform fosters an environment that encourages carpooling and ridesharing, connecting students,
                faculty, and staff who share similar commutes and destinations.  </p>
            <h3>Our Story  </h3>
            <p>UniGo was founded by Krupal Patel and Yash Patel, who were driven by a passion for improving the method of
                commute for members of the University, reducing our carbon footprint, and creating a more connected
                university community. They recognized the challenges faced by their peers during daily commutes, such as
                unreliable public transportation, long waiting times, and harsh weather conditions in Saskatchewan winters. </p>
            <p>In response to these challenges, they developed UniGo, a user-friendly web-app that intelligently presents users
                with compatible ride-sharing options. </p>
